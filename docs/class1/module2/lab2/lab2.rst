Lab 2 - Deploy the NAP in AKS
#############################

It is time to expose and protect Sentence Application. To do so, the NAP will be deployed in your AKS and will route traffic to the right services.

As a reminder (kubectl get services), the FrontEnd service is called ``sentence-frontend-nginx`` and listening on port ``80``

In your Github repo, check the files

  * nginx-nap/etc/nginx/upstream.d/http-sentence.conf -> this is the upstream (the sentence-frontend-nginx service)
  * nginx-nap/etc/nginx/vhosts.d/http-sentence.conf -> this is the vhosts (choose any fqdn for your lab)

We will have a look later on the NAP policy tree

|

Deploy the NAP in your AKS via Terraform
****************************************

In order to be **immutable**, we will use Terraform for Config as Code, and Infra as Code.

**Immutable** : An application or service is effectively redeployed each time any change occurs

In this module, we will not use any CI tool. You will be the CI tool and run the command manually. So that you understand all the steps equired to do DevSecOps.

First, adapt the Terraform with your environment information

  * Modify the plan accordingly so that the image is pulled from your private repository (line 36)
  * and also point to your kubeconfig context (line 3)

Go to the ``terraform`` folder and execute the terraform plan

  .. code-block:: bash

    terraform init
    terraform plan -auto-approve
    terraform apply -auto-approve

Check and test your NAP
***********************

* First of all, check the pod and the services

  .. code-block:: bash

    ❯ kubectl get pods -n sentence

* As you can notice, an Azure LB with a public address has been created by the Terraform plan
* Modify your ``host`` file in order to result the value set in the file ``nginx-nap/etc/nginx/vhosts.d/http-sentence.conf`` with this IP address

  .. code-block:: bash

    example in nginx-nap/etc/nginx/vhosts.d/http-sentence.conf
    server {
        server_name my-sentence-matt.lab.nordics;
        listen 80;

    Change your host file to resolv my-sentence-matt.lab.nordics with 20.67.132.103
    

* Test your deployment http://<your_fqdn>

* Send an attack ``http://<your_fqdn>?a=<script>``
* Attack is blocked
